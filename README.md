# Personal Website – Lorena Rangel

This project represents a simple yet elegant personal website, designed to showcase my skills and experience as a **Senior Software Engineer**. More importantly, it provided me with a valuable opportunity to explore **React**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS** — technologies I had not worked with before.

While building this project, I focused on simplicity and clarity, using a lightweight **React + Vite** setup, complemented by clean **CSS**, to create a professional personal landing page. This website not only presents my core technical experience but also reflects the attention to detail and care I bring to the software I build.

It’s a small project, but it helped me understand component-based development and the flexibility of modern frontend tooling.
